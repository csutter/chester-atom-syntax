# Chester

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This theme is no longer updated

I haven't used Atom for a long time now and haven't been updating this theme, which means it
doesn't take advantage of recent Atom features and may be completely incompatible with future
major releases.

As of May 2017, there are two active forks for you to pick from:

[RuslanIsrafilov/chester-atom-syntax](https://github.com/RuslanIsrafilov/chester-atom-syntax)

[SpectralKH/chester-syntax](https://github.com/SpectralKH/chester-syntax)

... or you can [search the Atom marketplace for "chester"](https://atom.io/themes/search?q=chester).

**Thanks for caring about this little pet project of mine, and I hope you've enjoyed using it!** üôÇ

A syntax highlighting theme for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) whose colours are totally
not ripped off from Lonely Planet's [Rizzo](https://github.com/lonelyplanet/rizzo) styles and what
do you even mean oh no please don't sue me.

There are also corresponding colour scheme for the iTerm2 and HyperTerm terminal emulators:
* [csutter/chester-iterm2-colors](https://github.com/csutter/chester-iterm2-colors)
* [ynnoj/hyperterm-chestered](https://github.com/ynnoj/hyperterm-chestered)
